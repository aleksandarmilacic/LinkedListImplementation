# LinkedList

The LinkedList project is a simple implementation of a linked list data structure in C++. It provides basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and printing of the linked list.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following files:

- **LinkedList.h**: This header file contains the class declaration for the LinkedList class, including function prototypes and member variable declarations.

- **LinkedList.cpp**: This source file contains the implementation of the LinkedList class member functions.

- **main.cpp**: This source file contains the `main` function, which demonstrates the usage of the LinkedList class.

## Usage

To compile and run the project, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source files using the following command:
```
g++ -std=c++11 LinkedList.cpp main.cpp -o linkedlist
```

4. Run the compiled executable:
```
./linkedlist
```


5. The program will demonstrate the usage of the LinkedList class by performing various operations on the linked list and printing the results.
